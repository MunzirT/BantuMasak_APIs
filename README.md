BantuMasak uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - API development tool that allows to test, manage and document APIs.
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - fast node.js network app framework

And of course BantuMasak itself is open source
